Rank 2:
Name: Candidate3
Background:
  Score: 80
  Description: Candidate3's background in Computer Science with an AI focus is highly relevant to the job description.  Being a third-year undergraduate slightly lowers the score, as the job description mentions 2+ years of coursework, implying a preference for those closer to graduation or beyond.

Industry:
  Score: 90
  Description: The candidate's interest in Artificial Intelligence, Software Development, and Technology aligns perfectly with the target industries of Software Development, AI/ML, Fintech, Consulting, and Investment Banking.

Skills:
  Score: 70
  Description: While the candidate's specific skills in Python, Go, Dart, Flutter, AWS, Firebase, and Supabase aren't explicitly stated, their AI/ML background suggests a strong likelihood of programming proficiency (Python, C++, Java are common in AI).  Further clarification is needed on specific skills. Their likely experience with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP is a strong plus.

Experience:
  Score: 60
  Description: The listed experience as an AI Engineer at both OpenAI and Apple during their undergraduate studies requires verification.  If genuine, it signifies exceptional talent and vastly exceeds expectations. However, the lack of detail about internships and personal projects makes it difficult to fully assess practical experience with the specified technologies.

Company Affiliations:
  Score: 90
  Description: Affiliations with OpenAI and Apple are highly impressive, especially for an undergraduate. This significantly boosts their profile, suggesting exposure to cutting-edge AI research and development.

Next Steps: The next step is to verify the candidate's work experience at OpenAI and Apple.  Requesting a resume and portfolio, as well as conducting a technical interview to assess their skills in the required technologies (Python, Go, Dart, Flutter, AWS, Firebase, and Supabase), is essential.  Clarifying the nature of their roles at OpenAI and Apple (full-time, internship, research, etc.) is crucial.  If the experience claims are accurate, this candidate is exceptionally promising.  Even if the experience is less extensive than presented, their background and affiliations still make them worth further consideration.

Rank 3:
Name: candidate2
Background:
  Score: 80
  Description: Candidate has a strong background in Computer Science, aligning perfectly with the job description.  While the candidate is still a second-year undergraduate, their experience at Apple significantly boosts their profile.

Industry:
  Score: 70
  Description: The candidate's experience in Software Engineering at Apple is valuable, though it leans more towards consumer electronics than the target industries (Fintech, AI/ML, etc.).  However, the software development skills are transferable.

Skills:
  Score: 60
  Description: While the candidate likely possesses strong programming skills (C++, Java, Python potential, Swift, Objective-C),  they lack explicit experience with the desired tech stack (Golang, Dart, Flutter, AWS, Firebase, Supabase, RAG).  Fundamental skills like problem-solving, communication, and teamwork are positive.

Experience:
  Score: 50
  Description: The internship/co-op experience is a plus, but the lack of detail about the specific role and projects makes it difficult to fully assess relevance.  Two years of coursework fulfills the minimum requirement.

Company Affiliations:
  Score: 70
  Description: Working at Apple is a significant positive.  It suggests a high level of technical competence and experience in a demanding environment.  Lack of open-source contributions or hackathon experience is not a major concern at this stage.

Next Steps: Candidate2 demonstrates potential. Schedule an interview to further evaluate technical skills, focusing on the desired tech stack (Golang, Dart, Flutter, AWS, Firebase, Supabase, RAG).  Explore the details of their internship experience at Apple to assess project relevance and gained skills.  Discuss their interest in the target industries (Fintech, AI/ML, etc.).
